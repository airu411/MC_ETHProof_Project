# MyToken

The project is MyToken.sol and contains a very simple creation of a token.

## Description

This is the code I did for my Solidity project in fulfillment of the ETH Proof Beginner course in Metacrafters. <br>
There are two main functions: mint and burn. <br>
The mint function is used to increment the total supply and the sender's balance, while the burn <br>
function is used to decrement the total supply and the sender's balance if the sender's balance satisfies a requirement.
